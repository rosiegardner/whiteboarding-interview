Question #3: Compressing Strings

Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them,
using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. 

For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. 

Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "aaabccdddda"

Output: "3ab2c4da"

Questions:
- Can I expect the input always be a string?

Possible Edge Cases
- What happens if there's multiple spaces and integers in the string?
  ex: "333 ee33e 4444 4 ddd"
- Empty string?


Solution without recursion

const count = "aaabccdddda";

function strCompress(str) {         // create a function 'strCompress' passing 'str' as the argument
  let compressStr = "";           // create a new string, which will hold compressed version of the orginial string.
  let strArray = str.split("");              // Split the string up into an array so we can iterate through it.
  for (let i = 0; i < strArray.length; i++) {        // create a for loop to keep track of each iteration
    let count = 1;                                  // setting the inital value of count to 1 for current consecutive letters.
    let letter = strArray[i];                      // and the actual letter 
    while (i < strArray.length - 1 && strArray[i] === strArray[i + 1]) {      // create a while loop compare letters with two conditions.
      count++                                                             // if 'i' is less than strArray length & if the current 'i' is equal to the next 'i'. 
      i++                                                                // increase the count & index position when conditions are met.
    }
    if (count === 1){                  // add the letter and number 
      compressStr += letter           // to our compressed string.
    } else {
      compressStr += letter + count
    }
  }
  return compressStr;  // return our compressed string
}

console.log(strCompress(count));
