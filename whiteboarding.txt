Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs

URLs cannot have spaces. 
Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. 
Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. 
Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

Questions: 
- What coding language do you prefer I use? Is JavaScript acceptable?
- Should I expect all inputs to be strings? 
- The output is a string with spaces between words replaced by the URL encode - '%20'
- I cannot use the .replace() method, correct?
- do we need to account for inputs involving integers?
- the output should not have any spaces?
- I'm assuming since the output has capitialization we don't need to account to coverting the output to lowercase??
- Should this be in recursion as well?

Possible Edge Case:
- Empty Strings?
- lowercase?

* Possible solution without recursion.

const string = "Jasmine Ann Jones";

function url(str) {            // create function 'url' and passing in 'str' as the argument.
  let newArray = str.split(" ");     // defining a new array=seperating string into an array using .split on spaces
  let newStr = str.join("$20");      // defining a new string rejoining the array into new string a replacing the spaces using .join.
  return newStr;              // returns new string
}

const stringConvert = url(string); // returns output 'Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones'

* Refactored with converting to lowercase with chained methods.

function url(str) {
  let newStr = str.toLowerCase().split(" ").join("%20");
  return newStr;
}

console.log(stringConvert);  // returns output 'jasmine$20ann%20jones'

Possible Solution with Recursion:

- create a basecase to check if the string is empty.
- use substring() method. - see README.md for more details.
- recursiveUrl(str.substring(1)); => substring(1) is saying to 'look at the first character", looking at 1 character at a time - until the string becomes empty.

function recursiveUrl(str) {    /// create function 'recursiveUrl' passing 'str' as argument.
  if (str === "") {   // if and when the string is empty, it will return string.
    return str;
  } else if (str[0] === " ") {   // if index position [0] is empty.
    return "%20" + recursiveUrl(str.substring(1)); // replace with URL encode '%20' - substring is creating a shallow copy of 'str' and has an endpoint of (1), telling it to look at the next character in the string.
  } else {
    return str[0] + recursiveUrl(str.substring(1)); // once finished iterating over each character, return str with spaces replaced with URL encode '%20'.
  }
};
